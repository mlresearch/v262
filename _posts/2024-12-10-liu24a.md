title: 'MisD-MoE: A Multimodal Misinformation Detection Framework with Adaptive Feature
  Selection'
section: Model Design \& Architecture
abstract: The rapid growth of social media has led to the widespread dissemination
  of misinformation across multiple content forms, including text, images, audio,
  and video. Compared to unimodal misinformation detection, multimodal misinformation
  detection benefits from the increased availability of information across multiple
  modalities. However, these additional features may introduce redundancy, where overlapping
  or irrelevant information is included, potentially disrupting the feature space
  and consequently impairing the modelâ€™s performance. To address the issue, we propose
  a novel framework, Misinformation Detection Mixture of Experts (MisD-MoE), which
  employs distinct expert models for each modality and incorporates an adaptive feature
  selection mechanism using top-k gating and Gumbel-Sigmoid. This approach dynamically
  filters relevant features, reducing redundancy and improving detection accuracy.
  Extensive experiments on the FakeSV and FVC-2018 datasets demonstrate that MisD-MoE
  significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods, with accuracy improvements of
  3.45% and 3.71% on the respective datasets compared to baseline models.

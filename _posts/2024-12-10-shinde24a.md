title: Lightweight Neural Networks for Speech Emotion Recognition using Layer-wise
  Adaptive Quantization
section: Applications
abstract: Speech Emotion Recognition (SER) systems are essential in advancing human-machine
  interaction. While deep learning models have shown substantial success in SER by
  eliminating the need for handcrafted features, their high computational and memory
  requirements, alongside intensive hyper-parameter optimization, limit their deployment
  on resource-constrained edge devices. To address these challenges, we introduce
  an optimized and computationally efficient Multilayer Perceptron (MLP)-based classifier
  within a custom SER framework. We further propose a novel, layer-wise adaptive quantization
  scheme that compresses the model by adjusting bit-width precision according to layer
  importance. This layer importance is calculated based on statistical measures such
  as parameter proportion, entropy, and weight variance within each layer. Our approach
  achieves an optimal balance between model size reduction and performance retention,
  ensuring that the quantized model maintains accuracy within acceptable limits. Traditional
  fixed-precision methods, while computationally simple, are less effective at reducing
  model size without compromising performance. In contrast, our scheme provides a
  more interpretable and computationally efficient solution. We evaluate the proposed
  model on standard SER datasets using features such as Mel-Frequency Cepstral Coefficients
  (MFCC), Chroma, and Mel-spectrogram. Experimental results demonstrate that our adaptive
  quantization method achieves performance competitive with state-of-the-art models
  while significantly reducing model size, making it highly suitable for deployment
  on edge devices.

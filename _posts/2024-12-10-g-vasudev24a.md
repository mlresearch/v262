title: 'The EarlyBird Gets the WORM: Heuristically Accelerating EarlyBird Convergence'
section: Model Efficiency \& Compression
abstract: The Lottery Ticket hypothesis proposes that ideal, sparse subnetworks, called
  lottery tickets, exist in untrained dense neural networks. The Early Bird hypothesis
  proposes an efficient algorithm to find these winning lottery tickets in convolutional
  neural networks, using the novel concept of distance between subnetworks to detect
  convergence in the subnetworks of a model. However, this approach overlooks unchanging
  groups of unimportant neurons near the searchâ€™s end. We propose WORM, a method that
  exploits these static groups by truncating their gradients, forcing the model to
  rely on other neurons. Experiments show WORM achieves faster ticket identification
  during training on convolutional neural networks, despite the additional computational
  overhead, when compared to EarlyBird Search. Additionally, WORM-pruned models lose
  less accuracy during pruning and recover accuracy faster, improving the robustness
  of a given model. Furthermore, WORM is also able to generalize the Early Bird hypothesis
  reasonably well to larger models, such as transformers, displaying its flexibility
  to adapt to more complex architectures.

title: 'ChemTEB: Chemical Text Embedding Benchmark, an Overview of Embedding Models
  Performance & Efficiency on a Specific Domain'
section: Benchmark \& Evaluation
abstract: Recent advancements in language models have started a new era of superior
  information retrieval and content generation, with embedding models playing an important
  role in optimizing data representation efficiency and performance. While benchmarks
  like the Massive Text Embedding Benchmark (MTEB) have standardized the evaluation
  of general domain embedding models, a gap remains in specialized fields such as
  chemistry, which require tailored approaches due to domain-specific challenges.
  This paper introduces a novel benchmark, the Chemical Text Embedding Benchmark (ChemTEB),
  designed specifically for the chemical sciences. ChemTEB addresses the unique linguistic
  and semantic complexities of chemical literature and data, offering a comprehensive
  suite of tasks on chemical domain data.        Through the evaluation of 34 open-source
  and proprietary models using this benchmark, we illuminate the strengths and weaknesses
  of current methodologies in processing and understanding chemical information. Our
  work aims to equip the research community with a standardized, domain-specific evaluation
  framework, promoting the development of more precise and efficient NLP models for
  chemistry-related applications. Furthermore, it provides insights into the performance
  of generic models in a domain-specific context. ChemTEB comes with open-source code
  and data, contributing further to its accessibility and utility.

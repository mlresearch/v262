title: 'Mai Ho‘omāuna i ka ‘Ai: Language Models Improve Automatic Speech Recognition
  in Hawaiian '
section: Applications
abstract: In this paper we address the challenge of improving Automatic Speech Recognition
  (ASR) for a low-resource language, Hawaiian, by incorporating large amounts of independent
  text data into an ASR foundation model, Whisper. To do this, we train an external
  language model (LM) on ∼1.5M words of Hawaiian text. We then use the LM to rescore
  Whisper and compute word error rates (WERs) on a manually curated test set of labeled
  Hawaiian data. As a baseline, we use Whisper without an external LM. Experimental
  results reveal a small but significant improvement in WER when ASR outputs are rescored
  with a Hawaiian LM. The results support leveraging all available data in the development
  of ASR systems for underrepresented languages.

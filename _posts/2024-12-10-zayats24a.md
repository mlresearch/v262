title: 'Zipper: A Multi-Tower Decoder Architecture for Fusing Modalities'
section: Model Design \& Architecture
abstract: Integrating multiple generative foundation models, especially those trained
  on different modalities, into something greater than the sum of its parts poses
  significant challenges. Two key hurdles are the availability of aligned data (concepts
  that contain similar meaning but is expressed differently in different modalities),
  and effectively leveraging unimodal representations in cross-domain generative tasks,
  without compromising their original unimodal capabilities. We propose Zipper, a
  multi-tower decoder architecture that addresses these concerns by using cross-attention
  to flexibly compose multimodal generative models from independently pre-trained
  unimodal decoders. In our experiments fusing speech and text modalities, we show
  the proposed architecture performs very competitively in scenarios with limited
  aligned text-speech data. We also showcase the flexibility of our model to selectively
  maintain unimodal (e.g., text-to-text generation) generation performance by freezing
  the corresponding modal tower (e.g. text). In cross-modal tasks such as automatic
  speech recognition (ASR) where the output modality is text, we show that freezing
  the text backbone results in negligible performance degradation. In cross-modal
  tasks such as text-to-speech generation (TTS) where the output modality is speech,
  we show that using a pre-trained speech backbone results in superior performance
  to the baseline.

title: Enhanced label noise robustness through early adaptive filtering for the self-supervised
  speaker verification task
section: Applications
abstract: Using clustering-driven annotations to train a neural network can be a tricky
  task because of label noise. In this paper, we propose a dynamic and adaptive label
  noise filtering method, called AdaptiveDrop which combines both label noise cleansing
  and correction simultaneously in cascade to combine their advantages. Contrary to
  other label noise filtering approaches, our method filters noisy samples on the
  fly from an early stage of training. We also provide a variant that incorporates
  sub-centers per each class for enhanced robustness to label noise by continuously
  tracking the dominant sub-centers via a dictionary table. AdaptiveDrop is a simple
  general-purpose method, performed end-to-end in only one stage of training, can
  be integrated with any loss function, and does not require training from scratch
  on the cleansed dataset. We show through extensive ablation studies for the self-supervised
  speaker verification task that our method is effective, benefits from long epochs
  of iterative filtering and provides consistent performance gains across various
  loss functions and real-world pseudo-labels.

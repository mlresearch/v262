title: Dense Backpropagation Improves Routing for Sparsely-Gated Mixture-of-Experts
section: Model Design \& Architecture
abstract: Sparsely-gated Mixture-of-Experts (MoEs) such as Gemini have proven to be
  more efficient than dense Transformers because they can dynamically activate a subset
  of their overall parameters by \emph{routing} tokens to selected “experts”, allowing
  practitioners to scale up model parameter counts without significantly increasing
  total compute. However, current MoE training approaches only update the router with
  a sparse gradient and suffer from issues such as load imbalance. We propose a new
  router that can receive a dense gradient update from a sparse forward pass. Our
  method adds minimal overhead, but improves on the common Top-K routing in both performance
  and load balance.
